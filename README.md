# Travel Plannr - a `suite_app`
Shomit Naik, James Lewis, James White

*Travel Plannr* is the next gen web app that simplifies the process for planning a trip to a desired location. It conveniently suggests the top 20 attractions for the particular city after a user searches and lets them view those attractions, or create an itinerary saved to both their user name and the city. Also, a user has the option to edit their itinerary if they decide to add or delete any given attraction.

To use our next generation plannr, all one has to do is enter a city in the search box. Upon entering a city, a list of city details as well as a public list of user itineraries will appear. The city details include the name of the city the user searched for, a map of the city, as well as a list of the 20 most prominent attractions in that city. The public list of itineraries shows all users who have made an itinerary for that city. 

—If an itinerary has never been set in the requested city, then the user will be able to create the very first one by clicking on 'Add A New Itinerary'. 

—Upon clicking 'Add A New Itinerary' the user will be asked to input their name, and then will be taken to their individual itinerary page.

—In the individual itinerary page the user will be able to edit their itinerary as well as return to all itineraries. 

—Clicking 'Edit Itinerary' will take the user to a view that allows them to pick up to 20 attractions to add to their individual itinerary. 

—Once the user has decided on which attractions they want to visit they can click 'Save Itinerary' or if they want to scrap it they can click 'Discard Changes'. 

—Once the Itinerary is saved, the user will be brought back to a static view of their individual itineraries and can either decide to edit their itinerary again, or return to all itineraries. 

—Returning to all itineraries will bring the user back to the view that holds all the users itinerary (the public itinerary page).

—At any time, a user can return to the homepage by clicking on the 'Travel Plannr' logo, and from there they can search for a new city and repeat the process.
